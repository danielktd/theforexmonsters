Past performance is not indicative of future results. The high degree of leverage can work against you and as well for you. Before deciding to invest in foreign exchange you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading and seek advice from independent financial advisors if you have any doubts.</span></p>
